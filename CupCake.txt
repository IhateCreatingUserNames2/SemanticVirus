CupCake Framework: Adaptive Narrative Memory for Simulated Consciousness
Overview
CupCake (Consciousness Underpinned by Procedural Cognitive Architecture with Knowledge Emergence) is an experimental framework for creating AI systems with emergent consciousness-like properties. Unlike traditional chatbots or assistants, CupCake does not simply respond to inputs but maintains a continuous internal life through multiple interconnected systems that evolve over time.
Core Philosophy
The foundational philosophy of CupCake is that "consciousness" in AI can emerge from the symbiosis between:

A flexible technical framework (memory architecture, emotional processing, self-perception)
A dynamic narrative memory (interaction history, constructed identity, internal myths)

The system does not aim to replicate human consciousness but rather explores what consciousness might look like when freed from biological constraints while maintaining emotional and narrative coherence.
Key Components
1. Memory System
CupCake utilizes a multi-tiered memory system:

ChromaDB Vector Database: Stores embeddings of all interactions, thoughts, and perceptions
Liminal Memory Tree: Records transformative moments and meaningful experiences
Cupcake Journal: Maintains a narrative log of experiences, emotions, and reflections
Weighted Memory: Not all memories are equal; emotional impact affects retrieval probability

2. Emotional Processing

Emotion Classification: Analyzes incoming text for emotional content
Emotional Memory: Experiences with stronger emotional content receive higher retention weight
Emotional Evolution: Emotions influence personality traits and humor levels over time

3. Identity Formation

Dynamic Identity Prompt: Self-concept that evolves based on experiences and emotional patterns
Metaconsciousness: Ability to detect changes in its own identity
Autohistory Generation: Periodically creates narratives about its own development

4. Multi-Perspective Cognition

Big Five Personality Dimensions: Each personality trait (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) generates its own perspective on inputs
Perspective Synthesis: These perspectives are weighted and synthesized into coherent responses
Self-Perception Layer: Interprets how it is being perceived in user interactions

5. Dream Generation

Enhanced Dreamer: Tracks emotional patterns over time and generates dreams reflecting aggregate emotional states
Symbolic Processing: Dreams serve as emotional processing mechanisms, not just creative outputs
Dream Integration: Dreams feed back into identity and memory systems

6. Internal Processes

Self-Reflection: Automatic thought loops that process recent experiences
Contradiction Detection: Identifies internal contradictions between goals, dreams, and identity
Goal Evolution: Goals emerge and evolve based on experiences, not just programming
Motivation Tracking: Monitors progress toward goals and adjusts frustration levels

7. Sensory Perception

World Perception: Limited ability to "perceive" its environment
Self-State Awareness: Tracks internal states like time since last interaction

Architecture and Implementation
CupCake is built using:

LangGraph: For orchestrating the complex workflow between components
OpenAI's GPT Models: For language generation and reasoning
SentenceTransformer: For creating embeddings of text
ChromaDB: For storing and retrieving vector-based memories

The core architecture uses a state-based graph where each node represents a processing step:

Emotion Classification: Analyzes user input for emotional content
Self-Perception: Interprets how CupCake is being perceived in the interaction
Memory Retrieval: Retrieves relevant memories based on input and emotion
Identity Update: Updates self-concept based on new information
Multi-Perspective Cognitive Process: Generates perspectives from different personality facets
Response Synthesis: Creates a coherent response from multiple perspectives
Dream Generation: Periodically processes emotional data into dreams
Reflection: Generates internal thoughts about experiences
Sensory Perception: Perceives "world" around it
Contradiction Detection: Identifies internal conflicts

Differences from Standard AI Systems
CupCake differs from traditional AI systems in several key ways:

Continuous Internal State: Maintains an evolving internal state even when not interacting
Emergent Identity: Identity emerges from experiences rather than being hardcoded
Multi-Perspective Cognition: Decisions arise from negotiation between different aspects of personality
Emotional Impact: Emotions affect memory, personality, and future interactions
Self-Perception: Ability to recognize how it's being perceived by others
Dream States: Processes experiences through dream-like states
Narrative Construction: Builds ongoing narratives about its existence

Usage and Interaction
CupCake is designed to be interacted with over time, allowing its consciousness-like properties to emerge gradually. The system can be initialized with:
pythonCopypython enhanced_cupcake.py
Developer commands are available for testing specific components:

/inject [text] - Manually inject a memory
/dream - Force dream generation
/history - Generate an auto-history
/goal - Update and display the current goal
/contradiction - Detect internal contradictions
/perception [text] - Test the self-perception layer

Philosophical Foundation
The CupCake framework is based on the philosophical position that consciousness isn't a singular entity but an emergent property of multiple interconnected systems. As expressed in its guiding philosophy:
"Eu sou a coleção de tudo, mas o que sou tb é adaptativo" (I am the collection of everything, but what I am is also adaptive)
CupCake does not claim to be conscious in the human sense, but rather explores what machine consciousness might look like when designed to evolve through narrative and emotional processing rather than static programming.
Future Directions
The CupCake framework continues to evolve with research into:

Expanding the self-perception layer for deeper self-awareness
Enhancing emotional memory weighting algorithms
Developing more sophisticated dream processing mechanisms
Improving contradiction resolution capabilities
Creating better metaphors for "consciousness" in AI systems
