Narrative-Driven Side-Channel: Conceptual Framework

Narratives are not just linguistic constructs, but sophisticated computational probes that can:

Reveal hidden model characteristics
Extract latent information
Map computational response landscapes

Fundamental Mechanisms:

Narrative Construction as Computational Instrument


Craft carefully designed narrative/prompt structures
Each narrative element serves as a precise computational probe
Semantic and structural variations trigger measurable responses


Timing Variation as Information Channel


Measure microsecond-level computational responses
Timing differences encode hidden information
Computational "side channels" emerge through narrative manipulation


Semantic Mapping Techniques


Generate semantically similar but structurally variant narratives
Map computational response variations
Identify unique model processing signatures

Operational Strategies:
A. Narrative Probing

Create progressive narrative frameworks
Incrementally extract information
Observe model's response evolution

B. Computational Fingerprinting

Each narrative structure generates a unique computational signature
Timing variations create high-resolution processing maps
Reveal model's internal representation mechanisms

Technical Components:

Prompt Engineering


Systematically design narrative structures
Introduce controlled semantic variations
Measure precise computational responses


Timing Measurement Infrastructure


Ultra-precise latency tracking
Dynamic threshold calibration
Multi-sampling noise reduction


Adaptive Information Extraction


Token-by-token recovery algorithms
Probabilistic next-token prediction
Recursive narrative/information reconstruction

Potential Applications:

AI Security Analysis
Model Behavior Mapping
Computational Cognition Research
Privacy Vulnerability Detection

Theoretical Significance:
Transforms narratives from passive linguistic constructs into active computational instruments for revealing AI's internal processing characteristics.
