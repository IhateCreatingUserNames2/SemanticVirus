Criticality Assessment Methodology
The Criticality Assessment methodology in the Edge of Coherence framework aims to find an optimal balance between predictability and novelty in language model outputs. It evaluates responses along a spectrum with three main zones:

Ordered Zone (0): Responses that are coherent but predictable - they make sense but don't offer novel insights
Critical Zone (1): The "sweet spot" where responses are both coherent and novel - this is the target zone
Chaotic Zone (2): Responses that are novel but lack coherence - they're creative but might not make logical sense
